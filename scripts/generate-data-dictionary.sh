# Exports the adjudications schema as a flat CSV data dictionary.
#
# The descriptions come from the COMMENT ON statements in db/migration/V130__schema_comments.sql and
# V132__schema_comments_sensitivity.sql, so this is the same source of truth as the SchemaSpy report.
# The sensitivity classification is pulled out of the trailing [Sensitivity: X] tag into its own
# column, so a consumer can filter on it rather than parse prose. The output is intended for the MOJ
# Data Catalogue / AWS Glue.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/generate-data-dictionary.sh [output-file]
#
# Expects a database built by Flyway. Connection details are taken from the environment, defaulting
# to the container in docker-compose-schema-spy.yml:
#   DB_HOST (localhost) DB_PORT (5432) DB_NAME (adjudications) DB_USER (adjudications)
#   DB_PASSWORD (adjudications) DB_SCHEMA (public)

-- this fix, but with 23 tables it is only a matter of time. It bit the incentives API for real (see
-- IR-1879), where the CSV silently gained six phantom rows. pg_constraint carries the owning
-- relation, so it cannot fan out.
